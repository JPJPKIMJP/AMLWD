# Alternative Approaches if FLUX Model Still Not Found

If the model still isn't found after redeploying, here are alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Copy Model to checkpoints Directory
Since VAE and CLIP models are working, and they're in standard directories, try copying the FLUX model to checkpoints:

```bash
# In regular pod
cp /workspace/ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/flux1-dev-kontext_fp8_scaled.safetensors \
   /workspace/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/

# Then update the workflow to use CheckpointLoaderSimple instead of UNETLoader
```

## Option 2: Use CheckpointLoaderSimple
Update the workflow to use a different loader:

```json
"37": {
  "inputs": {
    "ckpt_name": "flux1-dev-kontext_fp8_scaled.safetensors"
  },
  "class_type": "CheckpointLoaderSimple",
  "_meta": {
    "title": "Load Checkpoint"
  }
}
```

Then update node connections:
- Connect output 0 to where model was connected
- Connect output 1 to where CLIP was connected (if needed)
- Connect output 2 to where VAE was connected (if needed)

## Option 3: Create Custom Symlink in Dockerfile
Add to Dockerfile.flux:

```dockerfile
# Create model directories
RUN mkdir -p /ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models && \
    mkdir -p /ComfyUI/models/checkpoints && \
    mkdir -p /ComfyUI/models/unet

# Add volume directive for diffusion_models
VOLUME ["/workspace", "/ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models"]
```

## Option 4: Direct Model Path in Handler
Modify the handler to directly specify the model path:

```python
# In flux_handler.py, before queueing
# Update the workflow to use the full path
for node_id, node in workflow.items():
    if node.get("class_type") == "UNETLoader":
        # Try different paths until one works
        model_paths = [
            "/runpod-volume/ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/flux1-dev-kontext_fp8_scaled.safetensors",
            "/runpod-volume/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/flux1-dev-kontext_fp8_scaled.safetensors",
            "/ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/flux1-dev-kontext_fp8_scaled.safetensors"
        ]
        for path in model_paths:
            if os.path.exists(path):
                node["inputs"]["unet_name"] = path
                logger.info(f"Using full model path: {path}")
                break
```

## Option 5: Debug Volume Mount
Check if diffusion_models is a recent addition that isn't properly synced:

```bash
# In regular pod
# Force sync by creating a marker file
touch /workspace/ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/VOLUME_SYNC_TEST.txt

# Then in serverless logs, check if this file appears
```

## Most Likely Solution
Based on the symptoms (other models work, only diffusion_models doesn't), the most likely issue is that the diffusion_models directory was created after the initial volume setup. Try Option 1 (copy to checkpoints) as the quickest fix.
