# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix FLUX Numpy Issue

## The Problem
- FLUX is working perfectly (generates in ~3 minutes)
- But crashes when saving due to missing numpy
- The Docker image was never rebuilt with numpy

## Fastest Solution: Use Replicate

Since we can't easily rebuild Docker right now, and you need sleep, here's the immediate fix:

### Option 1: Quick Replicate Integration
```javascript
// Replace the RunPod call in generateImageSecure with:
const response = await fetch('https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_REPLICATE_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    version: 'black-forest-labs/flux-dev',
    input: {
      prompt: validatedInput.prompt,
      width: validatedInput.width,
      height: validatedInput.height
    }
  })
});
```

Cost: ~$0.03 per image vs ~$0.90 with RunPod cold starts

### Option 2: Manual Docker Fix (Tomorrow)

1. Install Docker Desktop: https://docker.com
2. Run: `./manual_docker_build.sh`
3. Scale RunPod workers 0â†’1

### Option 3: GitHub Workflow (Tomorrow)

1. Go to: https://github.com/JPJPKIMJP/AMLWD
2. Create file: `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`
3. Paste content from `docker-workflow.txt`
4. Add Docker Hub secrets
5. Run workflow

## My Recommendation

Switch to Replicate for now. It's:
- 95% cheaper
- No cold starts
- No numpy issues
- Working in 5 minutes

RunPod is great for persistent workloads, but for on-demand FLUX generation, Replicate has already solved all these problems.
