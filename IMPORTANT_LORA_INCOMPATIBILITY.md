# ⚠️ CRITICAL: SD1.5 LoRAs Are NOT Compatible with FLUX

## The Issue
You're experiencing "lora key not loaded" errors because **SD1.5 LoRAs cannot work with FLUX models**. This is a fundamental architectural incompatibility, not a bug.

## Why This Happens
- FLUX has a completely different architecture than SD1.5/SDXL
- LoRA models must be trained specifically for the base model they're used with
- When you try to load an SD1.5 LoRA with FLUX, ComfyUI ignores all the incompatible keys
- The image generates successfully but without any LoRA style modifications

## Current Status
- ✅ Image generation works
- ❌ LoRA styles are NOT being applied
- ⚠️ All "lora key not loaded" warnings are expected with incompatible LoRAs

## The Solution

### Option 1: Use FLUX-Compatible LoRAs
You need to obtain LoRAs specifically trained for FLUX:
1. Search for "FLUX LoRA" on platforms like Civitai or Hugging Face
2. Make sure to filter by "FLUX" base model
3. Download FLUX-compatible LoRAs only

### Option 2: Use SD1.5/SDXL Models Instead
If you want to use your existing SD1.5 LoRAs:
1. Switch to using SD1.5 or SDXL base models
2. Update your workflows to use the appropriate model loader
3. Your existing LoRAs will work properly

### Option 3: Disable LoRA for FLUX
If you want to continue using FLUX without LoRAs:
1. Set lora_name to "none" in the UI
2. This will use the standard FLUX workflow without attempting to load incompatible LoRAs

## Next Steps

To add FLUX-compatible LoRAs to your system:

1. Find FLUX LoRAs (example sources):
   - https://civitai.com/models (filter by FLUX)
   - https://huggingface.co/models (search "flux lora")

2. Update the `flux_handler.py` known_loras dictionary with FLUX-compatible LoRAs:
   ```python
   known_loras = {
       # Add FLUX-compatible LoRAs here:
       "flux_anime_style": "your_firebase_url_here",
       "flux_realistic": "your_firebase_url_here"
   }
   ```

3. Upload the FLUX LoRAs to Firebase Storage and update the URLs

## Technical Details

The error messages you're seeing:
```
lora key not loaded: lora_unet_down_blocks_0_attentions_0_proj_in.alpha
lora key not loaded: lora_unet_down_blocks_0_attentions_0_proj_in.lora_down.weight
...
```

These indicate that the LoRA is trying to modify layers that don't exist in FLUX's architecture. This is expected behavior when using incompatible LoRAs.

## Summary

**Your current SD1.5 LoRAs (mix4.safetensors, shiyuanlimei_v1.0.safetensors) will NEVER work with FLUX.** You need FLUX-specific LoRAs to get style modifications working.
